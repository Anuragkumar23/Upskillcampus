Title: Machine Learning-Based Smart City Traffic Forecasting Model

I successfully finished my internship at Uniconverge Technologies, which included this project.
This project presents a cutting-edge smart city traffic forecasting model that leverages machine learning techniques to predict traffic patterns and congestion levels. By analyzing historical traffic data, weather conditions, public events, and other relevant factors, the model generates accurate predictions for future traffic flow. This predictive capability equips urban planners and transportation authorities with valuable insights to optimize traffic management, enhance commuter experiences, and reduce congestion-related challenges. The project contributes to the advancement of smart city initiatives by providing an innovative solution for proactive traffic management and improved urban mobility.
